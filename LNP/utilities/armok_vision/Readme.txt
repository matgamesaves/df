*** Installation ***
    At a minimum, Armok Vision needs a copy of Dwarf Fortress with a recent build of DFHack installed
on top of it. 
    For a complete experience, you either need a copy of DFHack built after the current version of
Armok Vision was released, or an updated RemoteFortressReader plugin for your platform. If none is
available, you can follow the instructions at https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/blob/master/docs/Compile.rst
to build your own. You will need to build from the develop branch of DFHack.
