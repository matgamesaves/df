Manually Adding a Layout
=======================
Find the layout for your operating system with the corresponding version that matches your version of Dwarf Fortress. Right click and 'Save link as...' to the same directory on your computer.

For example if you're using windows, copy the layout to your Dwarf-Therapist/share/memory_layouts/**windows** directory.

Below are links to the most recent layouts.
